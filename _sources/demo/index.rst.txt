Demo
=================

Through the following examples, we show detailed demos on how to use this solver in two instances of the matching problem.   
For each problem, we answer the following questions:

#. How to construct the input tensors and projection maps for the solver.
#. How to execute the solver.
#. How to interpret the results and do inference.
#. How to define a new objective class for new applications. 

The two specific examples are:
